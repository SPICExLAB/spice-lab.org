  ### The Smart Sensing for Humans (SmaSH) Lab develops innovative sensing
  systems to solve problems of immediate impact related to health,
  accessibility, novel interactions, activity recognition, and technologies for
  the developing world. We are an interdisciplinary team of students who tackle
  challenging research problems and develop impactful solutions using our
  expertise in hardware development, signal processing, computer vision, and
  machine learning. We build and evaluate deployable solutions and test their
  utility in the real world.


  ### We are always looking to work with great students. If you are interested in contributing to research in our lab, fill this [form](https://forms.gle/yCU88JFYAMZSsT8X8) out.
