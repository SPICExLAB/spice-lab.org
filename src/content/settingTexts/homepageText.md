  The SPICE Lab at Northwestern University creates cutting-edge computing technologies that sense, track, and understand humans to augment their interactions and assist them in daily life. Our interdisciplinary team tackles challenging research problems in high-impact application areas such as mobile health sensing, mixed reality, embodied perception and natural user interfaces. We leverage expertise in novel sensors & sensing techniques, embedded systems, signal processing, computer vision, and on-device machine learning to deploy and evaluate these technologies in real-world settings.
