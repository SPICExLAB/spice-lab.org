## Abstract

Innovations in spatial computing and artificial intelligence (AI) are making it possible to overlay dynamic, interactive digital elements on the physical world. Soon, every object might have a real-time digital twin, enabling the “Internet of Things” so as to identify and interact with even unconnected items. This programmable reality would enable computational manipulation of the world around us through alteration of its appearance or functionality, similar to software, but for reality itself. Advances in AI language models have enabled zero-shot segmentation and understanding of the world, making it possible to query and manipulate objects with precision. However, this vision also demands natural and intuitive ways for humans to interact with these models through gestures, gaze, and existing devices. Augmented reality (AR) provides the ideal bridge between AI output and human input in the physical world. Moreover, diffusion models and physics simulations offer exciting possibilities for content generation and editing, allowing us to transform everyday activities into extraordinary experiences. As AR devices become ubiquitous and indistinguishable from reality, these technologies blur the lines between reality and simulations. This raises profound questions about how we perceive and experience the world while having implications for memory, learning, and even behavior. Programmable reality enabled by AR and AI has vast potential to reshape our relationships with the digital realm, ultimately making it an extension of the physical realm.
