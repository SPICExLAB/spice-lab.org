## Abstract

Worn sensors are popular for automatically tracking exercises. However, a wearable is usually attached to one part of the body, tracks only that location, and thus is inadequate for capturing a wide range of exercises, especially when other limbs are involved. Cameras, on the other hand, can fully track a user's body, but suffer from noise and occlusion. We present GymCam, a camera-based system for automatically detecting, recognizing and tracking multiple people and exercises simultaneously in unconstrained environments without any user intervention. We collected data in a varsity gym, correctly segmenting exercises from other activities with an accuracy of 84.6%, recognizing the type of exercise at 93.6% accuracy, and counting the number of repetitions to within +-1.7 on average. GymCam advances the field of real-time exercise tracking by filling some crucial gaps, such as tracking whole body motion, handling occlusion, and enabling single-point sensing for a multitude of users.
